                <p style="text-align: justify;">The future of aviation in the Philippines is likely to be impacted by a number of factors, including the country's growing population and economy, as well as increasing demand for air travel within the region.<br>
                   The Philippine government has identified tourism as a major driver of economic growth, and the country's Department of Transportation has been working to modernize and expand the country's aviation infrastructure to meet the rising demand for air travel.
                    
                    However, the Philippines is also facing challenges that could impede the growth of the aviation industry, such as overcapacity in the domestic market, limited airport capacity and air traffic control infrastructure, and safety concerns.<br> 
                    In order to overcome these challenges, the government is focused on investing in modernization and expansion of the country's airports and air traffic control system, as well as implementing stricter safety regulations for airlines.
                    
                    One of the key drivers of growth in the Philippine aviation industry is tourism. The government has identified tourism as a major driver of economic growth, and the Department of Tourism has been working to promote the country as a tourist destination.<br>
                    This has led to increased investment in the aviation infrastructure and has resulted in the construction of new airports and the expansion of existing ones.
                    As the tourism industry continues to grow, it is expected that the number of tourists visiting the Philippines will also increase, leading to a corresponding increase in the demand for air travel.<br> 
                    This will likely result in the expansion of the country's airline industry, as well as the opening of new routes and the introduction of new airlines.
                    
                    Overall, the future of aviation in the Philippines is expected to be characterized by significant growth and expansion, driven by rising demand for air travel, economic development and government infrastructure investment.<br> 
                    The government and private sectors are working together in order to overcome the challenges facing the industry and create a more sustainable and profitable future for the Philippine aviation industry.

                    <p style="text-align: justify;">(The future of the aviation industry, one word, is dicey. Because we have an enemy with so many variables. We don’t even see this freaking COVID-19. So it’s really really dicey.)
                        The transport chief also claimed that there are “many airlines” around the world that are now declaring bankruptcy.</p>
                    <p style="text-align: justify;">Local carriers have suspended operations since mid-March after the government imposed a Luzon-wide lockdown to halt the spread of the viral illness.<br> 
                        Major low-cost carriers also had to lay off workers and enforce pay cuts to mitigate the effects of the lockdown.
                        The local aviation industry took a bigger hit when the government suspended all domestic and international travel in and out of the Philippines.</p>
